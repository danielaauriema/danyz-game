# danyz-game
A Delphi platfom game using my Dises Game Engine Library

To run this project you need first to install my Dises Game Engine Library: https://github.com/danielaauriema/dises-game-engine


It isn't the best platform game and is very far from Super Mario Bros but it demonstrates that you can make a sofisticated game using only a basic programming language.



You can see it running in my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV6BUFb0Vec
